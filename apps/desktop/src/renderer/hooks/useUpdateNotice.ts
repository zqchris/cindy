 * Two dialog modes with very different data / UX contracts:
 *
 *   - `auto`  — fired once per launch after a version upgrade. Loads the diff
 *              `(lastRead, appVersion]` (max N) all up front. Badge is static
 *              `v<oldest> → v<newest>`. Dismissal advances `lastReadVersion`.
 *
 *   - `manual`— fired by user clicking the flame icon. Loads only appVersion's
 *              notes up front; the rest of the history is exposed via
 *              `allVersions` and lazy-fetched via `loadVersion` as the dialog
 *              scrolls placeholders into view. Badge tracks the topmost
 *              visible version + doubles as a dropdown to jump to any version.
 *              Dismissal does NOT touch lastReadVersion (manual look-back
 *              must not suppress the next real upgrade popup).
 *
 * `onOpenVersion(pending)` is a third entry point — the sidebar UpdateBanner
 * previewing an update that is downloaded but **not installed yet**. It reuses
 * the `auto` layout contract verbatim (pre-loaded blocks, `v旧 → v新` badge,
 * version count, no lazy history, no version jumper) because it carries the
 * same shape of payload: an aggregated diff range. The only difference is which
 * range — auto covers `(lastRead, appVersion]`, preview covers
 * `(appVersion, pending]`, so a user who skipped several releases sees every
 * version the restart will jump over, and a plain one-version bump sees one
 * block.
 *
 * Two things it deliberately does NOT do: attach the installed version or its
 * back-catalogue (that's the flame icon's job — `onOpen`), and advance
 * `lastReadVersion` on dismiss (that would swallow the real popup after the
 * restart). The read-marker, not `mode`, is what governs the latter — see
 * `readMarkerRef`.
